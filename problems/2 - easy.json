    "problem": "Write a complete C++ program that reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶), followed by n integers representing an array A. The program must find the largest element in the array and print the index of its last occurrence (0-based index).",
    "input_desc": "The input consists of a sequence of integers separated by spaces. The first integer is n, representing the number of elements in the array. The next n integers are the elements of array A, where each element satisfies |A[i]| ≤ 10⁹. Input is read from standard input (cin).",
