__Problem: Write a C++ program that reads a series of integers entered from the keyboard until the input value is 0. Then print to the screen a list of negative integers in the order entered and separated by a space.
__Input_Desc: The input data is a list of integers (each value is separated by a space), in the input integers there always exists a value 0 that appears randomly at any position in the sequence.
__Output_Desc: If there is a negative number before 0, print a list of negative numbers in the array, keeping the order they were entered, separated by spaces. If there is no negative number before 0, print NOT FOUND
__Test_Case:
-1 3 -2 5 -4 0 -> -1 -2 -4
1 2 3 4 0 -> NOT FOUND
9 9 -3 0 -2 6 -1 -1 8 0 9 -> -3
