__Problem: Write a complete C++ program that reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶), followed by n integers representing an array A. The program must find the largest element in the array and print the index of its last occurrence (0-based index). 
__Input_Desc: The input consists of a sequence of integers separated by spaces. The first integer is n, representing the number of elements in the array. The next n integers are the elements of array A, where each element satisfies |A[i]| ≤ 10⁹. Input is read from standard input (cin).
__Output_Desc: Print exactly one integer, which is the index of the last occurrence of the largest element in the array. No extra text, no explanations, only the integer.
__Test_Case:
5 1 3 2 4 0 -> 3
5 9 -9 12 -7 3 -> 2
6 1 -4 9 2 9 4 -> 4
9 14 8 -12 14 13 2 14 -9 3 -> 6
6 -99 -75 -8 -13 -8 -39 -> 4
